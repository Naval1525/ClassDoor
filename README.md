# 🎓 Classdoor

> **Real talk, Real reviews — A platform for students, by students.**

Classdoor is an anonymous, real-time platform built for students to openly share experiences about professors, courses, and campus life. Think of it as a mix of **Glassdoor**, **Reddit**, and **RateMyProfessors**, specially designed for the college ecosystem.

---

## 📌 Overview

Classdoor empowers students to:
- ✅ Share anonymous reviews of professors and courses
- 🧩 Discuss campus culture — from hostels and fests to societies and placements
- 💬 Engage in real-time, anonymous Q&A boards per college
- 🔥 Discover trending professors, topics, and courses via insights

Built with **privacy**, **scalability**, and **community** in mind, Classdoor serves as a transparent guide for current and prospective students.

## 🎯 The Problem It Solves

🎓 Students often face these challenges:
- No central platform for **honest, anonymous reviews**
- Difficult to make informed choices about **courses**, **faculty**, or **campus life**
- Lack of transparency and student voice in academic environments

Classdoor solves this by offering an open, safe space for students to speak freely — helping future students make better decisions.
